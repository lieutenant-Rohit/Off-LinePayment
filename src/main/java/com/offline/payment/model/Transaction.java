/*
 * ========================================================================
 * THE "SECURITY DNA" OF THIS TRANSACTION
 * ========================================================================
 * * 1. THE PERMANENT INK (Audit Trail):
 * Think of the 'Account' table as a chalkboard that gets erased and
 * updated with new balances. This 'Transaction'
 * table is the permanent stone carving.
 * Even if a balance looks wrong, we can look here to see the exact
 * history of where every rupee went.
 *
 * 2. THE ONE-TIME TICKET (Idempotency Shield):
 * Because this is a Mesh Network, your payment is copied like a rumor
 * across many phones.
 * When those phones hit the internet, the bank might get 10 copies of
 * this same payment. The 'packetHash' is
 * the fingerprint that tells the bank: "I already handled this
 * specific person's request; ignore the other 9 copies".
 *
 * 3. THE DELIVERY MAP (Mesh Intelligence):
 * By recording 'hopCount' (how many phones touched it) and
 * 'bridgeNodeId' (who finally hit the internet), we can see exactly
 * how the payment traveled. It’s like
 * tracking a package to see which route the delivery driver took
 * through the city.
 *
 * 4. THE EXPIRATION DATE (Temporal Integrity):
 * We store 'signedAt' to know when the user originally hit "Pay"
 * while offline. If a hacker tries to
 * "replay" this same encrypted packet a week later, the bank will
 * see the old date and reject it because the "Freshness Window" is
 * closed.
